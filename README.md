**Rythmix Dashboard** is an AI-powered heart sound analysis platform that enables users and medical specialists to identify early signs of cardiac diseases through intelligent, real-time audio classification and visualization. Built with ReactJS and powered by TensorFlow deep learning models, the dashboard provides an intuitive interface for at-home cardiac health screening, comprehensive data management, and robust analytics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide[1][15]. The inspiration behind Rythmix came from the increasing cases of cardiovascular diseases that often go undetected until they become severe. We noticed that while hospitals have advanced diagnostic equipment, people rarely go for regular check-ups due to time, cost, and accessibility barriers.

**Rythmix** bridges this gap by offering the first device to leverage deep learning (TensorFlow) for classifying heart sounds, enabling both users and specialists to identify early signs of cardiac diseases and take timely action from the comfort of home.
